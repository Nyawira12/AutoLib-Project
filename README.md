# Description
This is an analysis of an electric ride share company, to highlight the most popular hours, and locations during which two models of their cars were used. In understanding how these cars are used, the company can optimise their reources in the most lucrative locations and times, while improving on the weaker areas. The analysis was performed using Python 3 and excel  to better understand the research problem. 
The best recommendation would be to scale operations in the areas and periods when their cars are most requested, with considerations on how to ease traffic during returning hours.
# Installations
